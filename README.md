# TXON_01

In this task, I have created a landing web 
page using basic HTML, And CSS. This is a 
very basic project for beginners. After 
completion of this project, I have been able 
to level up your CSS. In this project, I have 
learnt how to divide a page into the header,
footer, body part, and griding system in 
web page.
